# Bike Sales Analysis 🚴‍♂️📊

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed a **Bike Sales Dataset** using **Excel** to derive insights into sales performance across various customer age groups and countries. The key analysis focused on summarizing the **sum of orders** and **quantity** sold, grouping customers by age categories, and using various Excel functions to visualize and analyze the data.

### Key Steps of Analysis 🔍

1. **Grouping Customers by Age** 👥
   - I categorized customers into three age groups: 
     - **Youth (<25)**
     - **Young Adult (25-34)**
     - **Adult (35-64)**
   - This segmentation helped evaluate how sales varied between different age groups.

2. **Sum of Orders & Quantity** 📦
   - I calculated the **sum of orders** and **quantity** sold to get a sense of overall sales performance for each group.

3. **Sales by Country** 🌍
   - Using **filters**, I categorized the sum of sales across different countries, allowing me to analyze the regional performance of each customer age group.

4. **Data Visualization** 📊
   - I created **Pivot Tables** to summarize the data by **age groups** and **countries**.
   - **Pivot Charts** and **Bar Charts** were used to visually represent the total sales by age group and country.
   - **Slicers** were added to make the analysis interactive and allow for easy filtering by specific parameters like age or country.

### Excel Functions Used 🛠️
- **SUM()**: To calculate the total sales for each product or customer group.
- **AVERAGE()**: To calculate the average sales across customer age groups.
- **Unique()**: To extract unique customer data.
- **Cell Referencing**: To link cells dynamically for real-time data analysis.
- **Filters**: To categorize and segment the data by customer age and country.
- **Slicers**: To add interactivity and allow filtering of data in pivot tables.

The dashboard is enhanced with **Slicers** to filter and interact with the data based on age group or country:

### Key Insights 🎯

- **Youth** (<25) category contributed the highest number of orders, but the **Young Adult** and **Adult** groups had higher average sales.
- Sales performance varied significantly across countries, with some regions showing higher sales for specific age groups.
- The interactive slicers allow users to drill down into specific data points, such as analyzing **sales performance by age group** within a particular country.
